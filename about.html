                   Hello! i'm Rimshah Ali<br>
                    
                    The goal for this travel blog is simple to share travel stories from around the globe.I hope that it will inspire you to travel more or help you plan that next big adventure you’ve been dreaming about.<br>
                     Travel is personal. It means different things to different people.<br> To some, it’s a one week vacation
                     to an all-inclusive hotel in the Caribbean. To others,it’s strapping on a backpack with no itinerary or end date.
                     The idea of travel,packing my bags and disappearing to someplace new, lives inside the brain al the time.<br>
                    
                    For example, whenever I meet someone for the first time or even encounter an old friend,I instantly want to talk about my upcoming trips, ask about their own adventures,share embarrassing and funny travel stories,
                     and swap bucket list ideas.
                    
                    And yeah, I’ll admit it. I’m probably a little annoying to my non-traveling friends and acquaintances, but I can’t help myself. 
                    My “wanderlusty” passion seeps through my pores, out of my control.
